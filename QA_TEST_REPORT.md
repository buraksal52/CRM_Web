## 🐛 Issues & Warnings Summary

### Critical Issues (0)
None found! 🎉

### Warnings (2)

#### ⚠️ Warning 1: Duplicate `__str__` Method in Task Model
**File:** `crm_app/models.py` (lines 48 & 51)  
**Impact:** Low - Python will use the second definition, but it's confusing  
**Fix:** Remove one of the duplicate `__str__` methods

```python
# Current (WRONG):
def __str__(self):
    return self.title

def __str__(self):
    return self.title

# Should be:
def __str__(self):
    return self.title
```

#### ⚠️ Warning 2: Task Assignment Shows User ID Instead of Username
**File:** `crm_frontend/src/pages/Tasks.jsx`  
**Impact:** Medium - UX issue, users see "User #5" instead of names  
**Fix:** Either:
1. Include username in Task serializer (backend change), OR
2. Fetch user list and map IDs to names (frontend change)

**Recommended Fix (Backend):**
```python
# In TaskSerializer
class TaskSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    assigned_to_name = serializers.CharField(source='assigned_to.username', read_only=True)
    
    class Meta:
        model = Task
        fields = '__all__'
```

### Minor Improvements (3)

#### 💡 Improvement 1: Add Email Validation on Register
Currently accepts any email format. Add stronger validation.

#### 💡 Improvement 2: Add Password Strength Indicator
Show password strength meter on register page for better UX.

#### 💡 Improvement 3: Add Bulk Delete
Allow admins to select multiple items and delete at once.
